The tracking of migratory animals is a very active field of biological study. Knowing the
positions visited and the routes travelled by migratory organisms is in fact crucial information,
for instance, to design management policies for species conservation or for managing disease
spread. This research field is particularly challenging and very interdisciplinary, because it
requires the integration of knowledge coming from biology and environmental science with that
coming from IT engineering. The continuous development of new devices which allow
monitoring, recording and sometimes transmitting the positions of individuals over long time
periods and large spatial extentsâ€”opens novel research perspectives that must be accompanied
by similarly advanced ways of interpreting the newly available data through proper modelling
and software.


The proposed research is aimed use GPS to track flight patterns of birds. The proposed aim
will be achieved by dividing the work into following objectives:
1. To understand and explore various variables like latitude, longitude, altitude, and time
stamps.
2. To study and analyze the data, visualize some simple flight trajectories, track flight
speed, learn about daytime.
3. To design and develop and visualize the patterns generated.
4. To verify and validate the proposed system.
